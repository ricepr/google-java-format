I could not find an email so I am trying this
Hello

I am Perry Rice, a former student of Howard Carmichael. 
This year marks Howards 40th year as a professor, 
and I wanted to collect letters from his former students to present to him. 
I do not have any format in mind, perhaps some remembrances and an update on 
what you have been up to. I’d like to receive these by the middle of October. 
I would ask that you consider providing a letter, and letting me know if you 
intend to so I know who will be participating. Howard had a profound effect 
on my life, and I’m sure others as well. I would like him to have a fungible 
record of his effect on his students. Thank you very much. Word or pdf is fine, 
no suggested length. If you could let me know if you intend to submit at 
ricepr@miamioh.edu. Also if you could send the letter there. Thanks much


								Cheers, Perry
